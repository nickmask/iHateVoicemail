#I Hate Voice Mail

I hate voicemail is a React Native project to automate the process of getting voice mail messages from Vodafone. The end goal is to have the app listen for new text messages, recoginise if they are a voicemail message, call vodafone, and convert the message to text. 

Why? Because I hate calling to listen to voice messages ðŸ˜‰
